## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Installation**

- Download or clone this repository.
- Extract the files if downloaded as a ZIP.
- Open the folder in your favorite editor (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad, etc).

### 2. **Customizing Text & Pages**

- Open the HTML files (such as `index.html`, `about.html`) and replace placeholder text with your church’s information.
- Each section is clearly labeled with comments and headings for easy editing.
- You can remove, duplicate, or rearrange `<section>` blocks as needed for your ministry.

### 3. **Changing Images**

- Replace placeholder images in the `/images` folder with your own church photos (keep the same filenames for easiest results, or update the filenames in the HTML if you use different names).
- Example: Replace `placeholder-worship.jpg` with a photo from your own church service.

### 4. **Styling**

- Adjust colors, fonts, and layout in `css/styles.css`. The template uses CSS variables for easy theme changes.
- The style is inspired by PNG’s colors (kundu drum red, betel nut gold, rainforest green).

### 5. **JavaScript**

- The `js/main.js` file automatically updates the copyright year.
- It also enhances mobile menu and can be expanded for form validation or other simple scripts.

## 💡 Tips

- **Contact Form:** By default, the form does not send emails. Use a service like [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Google Forms] to handle submissions, or connect to a backend script if your host supports PHP.
- **Giving/Donate:** Edit the giving section in `services.html` to include your bank, mobile money, or online giving details.
- **Accessibility:** All sections use ARIA and semantic elements, but always test with your audience and improve as needed.
